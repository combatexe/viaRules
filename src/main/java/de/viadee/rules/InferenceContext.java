/**
 * <p>An {@link InferenceContext} is used every time a set of rules shall be evaluated. Currently you'll most
 * likely cast the context instance to your specific implementation and use that instead of the generic
 * interface defined here. The only available method in the generic version is {@link #getGist()} which returns
 * the main or focal point of your rules (if any).</p>
 *
 * <p>Note that no factory or builder is defined for the <code>InferenceContext</code> so you will have to implement
 * the concrete implementation and create an instance out of it yourself.</p>
 *
 * <h1>Caveats</h1>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>No Problems known</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h1>Examples</h1>
 * <p>No examples so far - interface is too abstract for that.</p>
 *
 * <h1>How to help</h1>
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Test the interface and write back about errors, bugs and wishes.</li>
 *  <li>Write an abstract implementation for this interface so others will have it easier to implement it themselves.</li>
 *  <li>Write an example of how to use an InferenceContext.</li>
 * </ul>
